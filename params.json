Just use ash as device control facility.\r\n\r\nashdi and [AshFa](https://github.com/sjp38/AshFa)'s PC control feature is one good example for ash interface layer application.\r\n\r\nAnybody can implement ash using any language, any platform, if and only if they support ash language syntax and basic operations properly.\r\nThis ash implementation is for linux. You can get an **ash for Android(AshFa)** from [Here](https://github.com/sjp38/AshFa).\r\n\r\nAshFa just works, but, not complete as an ash. AshFa is just an example. You can make your ash for Android and publish it anywhere.\r\n\r\n# Demo video\r\nYou can see demo video of ash from [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=KR&hl=en&client=mv-google&v=XaA7UHmpJsU&t=0s&nomobile=1)\r\n\r\n# News\r\n - ash 2.0 have announced from [Google HackFair, Korea](http://googlekoreablog.blogspot.kr/2012/11/google-hackfair_6.html) and released by 19th, November 2012(EST).\r\n - Next minor version update will be done by few months.\r\n\r\n# License\r\nGPL v3.\r\nAnyone can use code of Ash everywhere.
